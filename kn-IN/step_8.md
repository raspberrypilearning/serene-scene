## What next?

In this project, you have:
- Created `variables`{:class="block3variables"} to store values for your sprites
- Used sliders to change the value of `variables`{:class="block3variables"} so that your sprites have a range of looks, movement, and sound
- Used `forever`{:class="block3control"} loops to make the interactive animation continue
