## Challenge: add a dragonfly

--- task ---

Add a **dragonfly** sprite to your project, and use a `variable`{:class="block3variables"} slider to control the speed at which the dragonfly moves. The dragonfly could move from side to side, like the grasshopper, but for an extra challenge, could you make the dragonfly move in `random`{:class="block3operators"} directions?
